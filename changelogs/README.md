# Daily Changelogs by Contributor

This directory contains daily changelog files for each contributor organized by date.

## How It Works

- **Daily aggregate reports**: `daily/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` - All commits for a specific day
- **Per-contributor reports**: `daily/contributors/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{username}.md` - Individual daily activity

## Generate Daily Reports

Daily reports are automatically generated via GitHub Actions, but you can also run:

```bash
npm run daily-report
```

> **Note**: Daily changelog files are automatically generated and committed by GitHub Actions. Manual generation is for testing only.
