# Daily Changelogs by Contributor

This directory contains daily changelog files for each contributor organized by date.

## How It Works

- **Daily aggregate reports**: `daily/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` - All commits for a specific day
- **Per-contributor reports**: `daily/contributors/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{username}.md` - Individual daily activity

## Generate Daily Reports

Daily reports are automatically generated via GitHub Actions, but you can also run:

```bash
npm run daily-report
```

> **Note**: Daily changelog files are auto-generated and ignored by git to prevent merge conflicts. Only GitHub Actions should commit these files to the repository.

## Navigation

- ï¿½ [View all daily reports](./daily/)
- ðŸ‘¥ [View all contributor reports](./daily/contributors/)

> **Daily files are automatically generated by GitHub Actions and are not tracked in git.**
